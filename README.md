# Lab9K.

>*“Without smart people, there are no smart cities.”*

We need people to help us cultivate the smartness of our beloved city. So we're calling upon all thinkers, dreamers, builders, designers, coders, pixelpushers, solder artists, data refiners.

Good ideas need to be built before they can be tested, building takes time and effort Lab9k will secure funding to compensate the hard work done by the participants. At the moment, we're still looking for students to work for us, since studentcontracts are flexible enough to support this model.

Also, if you want to do an internship let us know.
